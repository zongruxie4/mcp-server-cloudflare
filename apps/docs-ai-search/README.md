# Cloudflare Documentation MCP Server (via AI Search) 🔭

This is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that supports remote MCP connections. It uses Cloudflare AI Search (AutoRAG) to provide contextual search of the Cloudflare Developer Documentation.

The Cloudflare account this worker is deployed on has an AI Search instance configured with the complete Cloudflare Developer Documentation.

## Access the remote MCP server from any MCP Client

If your MCP client has first class support for remote MCP servers, the client will provide a way to accept the server URL (`https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com`) directly within its interface (for example in [Cloudflare AI Playground](https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/)).

If your client does not yet support remote MCP servers, you will need to set up its respective configuration file using [mcp-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) to specify which servers your client can access.

Replace the content with the following configuration:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"cloudflare": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["mcp-remote", "https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp"]
		}
	}
}
```

Once you've set up your configuration file, restart MCP client and a browser window will open showing your OAuth login page. Proceed through the authentication flow to grant the client access to your MCP server. After you grant access, the tools will become available for you to use.
