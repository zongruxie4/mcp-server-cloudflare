# Cloudflare DEX MCP Server ðŸ“¡

This is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that supports remote MCP
connections, with Cloudflare OAuth built-in.

It integrates tools powered by the [Cloudflare DEX API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/zero_trust/subresources/dex/) to provide visibility into device, network, and application performance across your Zero Trust organization

### Prompt Examples

- `Are there any anomolies in the DEX test to the internal wiki in the past 24 hours?`
- `Can you see any bottlenecks in user@cloudflare.com's network path for Zoom today between 1 and 2 PM?`
- `How many macOS devices are connected right now in DFW?`
- `Do you notice any unusual performance metrics for user@cloudflare.com's device in the past few hours?`
- `Capture a WARP diag for user@cloudflare.com and make sure to test all routes`
- `Which users have toggled off WARP recently?`
- `Which Cloudflare colo is most used by my users in the EU running DEX application tests?`
- `Look at the latest WARP diag for user@cloudflare.com and tell me if you see anything notable in dns logs`

## Access the remote MCP server from any MCP Client

If your MCP client has first class support for remote MCP servers, the client will provide a way to accept the server URL (`https://dex.mcp.cloudflare.com`) directly within its interface (for example in [Cloudflare AI Playground](https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/)).

If your client does not yet support remote MCP servers, you will need to set up its respective configuration file using [mcp-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) to specify which servers your client can access.

Replace the content with the following configuration:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"cloudflare": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["mcp-remote", "https://dex.mcp.cloudflare.com/sse"]
		}
	}
}
```

Once you've set up your configuration file, restart MCP client and a browser window will open showing your OAuth login page. Proceed through the authentication flow to grant the client access to your MCP server. After you grant access, the tools will become available for you to use.
