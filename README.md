# Cloudflare MCP Server Monorepo

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a [new, standardized protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for managing context between large language models (LLMs) and external systems. In this repository, we provide an installer as well as an MCP Server for [Cloudflare's API](https://api.cloudflare.com).

This lets you use Claude Desktop, or any MCP Client, to use natural language to accomplish things on your Cloudflare account, e.g.:

* `Please deploy me a new Worker with an example durable object.`
* `Can you tell me about the data in my D1 database named '...'?`
* `Can you copy all the entries from my KV namespace '...' into my R2 bucket '...'?`

## Access the remote MCP server from Claude Desktop

Open Claude Desktop and navigate to Settings -> Developer -> Edit Config. This opens the configuration file that controls which MCP servers Claude can access.

Replace the content with the following configuration. Once you restart Claude Desktop, a browser window will open showing your OAuth login page. Complete the authentication flow to grant Claude access to your MCP server. After you grant access, the tools will become available for you to use.

```

  "mcpServers": {
    "math": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp-cloudflare-staging.r.workers.dev/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Paid Features

Some features in this MCP server require a paid Cloudflare Workers plan:

- **Observability**: The prefixed `worker_logs_` tools require a paid Workers plan to access these metrics

Ensure your Cloudflare account has the necessary subscription level for the features you intend to use.

## Features

### Workers Management
- `worker_list`: List all Workers in your account
- `worker_get_worker`: Get a Worker's script content

### Workers Logs
- `worker_logs_by_worker_name`: Analyze recent logs for a Cloudflare Worker by worker name
- `worker_logs_by_ray_id`: Analyze recent logs across all workers for a specific request by Cloudflare Ray ID
- `worker_logs_keys`: Get available telemetry keys for a Cloudflare Worker
